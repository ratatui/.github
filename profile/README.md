![Demo of Ratatui](https://github.com/tui-rs-revival/ratatui/assets/24392180/93ab0e38-93e0-4ae0-a31b-91ae6c393185)

`ratatui` is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) library to build rich terminal
user interfaces and dashboards. It is heavily inspired by the `Javascript`
library [blessed-contrib](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib) and the
`Go` library [termui](https://github.com/gizak/termui).

See the [repository](https://github.com/tui-rs-revival/ratatui) for more information and usage examples!

## What is this organization?

This organization was created to continue maintenance on the original [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs) project. The original maintainer had created [an issue](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs/issues/654) explaining how he couldn't find time to continue development, which led to us creating this organization.

With that in mind, **we the community** look forward to continuing the work started by [**Florian Dehau**](https://github.com/fdehau). ðŸš€
